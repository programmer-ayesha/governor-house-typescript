// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

let countries:string[] = ["LONDON","JAPAN","PAKISTAN","AMERICA","BRAZZIL"];
console.log("List of Contries");
countries.map((item)=> console.log(item));
